Lahman Baseball Database Analysis Project

Overview:

This project utilizes the Lahman Baseball Database, made available online by Sean Lahman. The database provides a comprehensive historical record of Major League Baseball statistics, making it a valuable resource for data analysis. The aim is to use SQL queries to answer specific initial questions and, if time permits, to explore open-ended questions. Toward the end of the bootcamp, there will be an opportunity to revisit this data using SQL, Excel Power Pivot, and Python for more in-depth analysis.
